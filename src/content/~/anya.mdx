<h2>How did I become Anya Forger?</h2>

2023, I had started watching <Pill text={"anime"}/> early in the year. By the time of October, I had watched multiple anime series and could not wait for the season 2 of "Spy x Family" to come out. I was so excited that I decided to become Anya Forger on the HackTheMountains Discord. I used the name "Anya Forger" and even created a custom profile picture of her. The community loved it, and I became known as Anya Forger in the Discord server.
