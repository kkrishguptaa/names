Officially ordained and recognized as the embodiment of chaos. Compared with the Greek primordial nyx, I am the personification of chaos. Known for causing chaos and mischief all over tech twitter.

Here is a video of YK Dojo himself, putting me in as "Embodiment of Chaos" in his CRM.

This also stems from the existence of Calm Krish on Twitter, which is a parody account of me, where I am calm and composed. It is a running joke that I am the embodiment of chaos while that account (still me) is the embodiment of calmness.
