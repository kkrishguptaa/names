This is not my birth name, but every single person just mispronounced [Krishna](./krishna) as Krishnaa. I did some research on this name.

This name belongs to Draupadi (Panchali), the wife of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata. She is also known as Krishnaa, which is a feminine form of Krishna. The name Krishnaa means "dark" or "black," and it is derived from the Sanskrit word "Krishna," which is one of the names of Lord Vishnu.

She is considered one of the forms of the goddess Shakti, the divine feminine energy, which is fascinating because I was born on the first day of Navratri, the festival when different forms of Shakti are worshipped as their energies enter the world.
