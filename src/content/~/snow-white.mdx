I just used to have very white skin, and people used to call me Snow White. It was a nickname that I had for about 2 year of COVID when I had little to no sun exposure. It was a joke that I was Snow White, and I had a lot of people living around me call me that.

NGL I'd love to get that white skin back, but I don't think I can. I have a lot of melanin in my skin, and I tan very easily. But it was a fun nickname to have, and it was a good time.

And no I do not like the nickname, I just think it was a fun time to have it. I don't want to be called Snow White anymore, but I do appreciate the memories that it brings back.

And it doesn't help that I could name all the 7 dwarves from the movie all the way up till the last time I tried in 2024.
